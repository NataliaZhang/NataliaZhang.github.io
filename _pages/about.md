Welcome! I am Natalia (Shuixiunan) Zhang, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [**Yao Class**](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

My research interests lie broadly in **machine learning** especially **reinforcement learning** (RL), **RL from human feedback** and **large language model** (LLM). 
I'm also interested in algorithmic **game theory**, **social computing** and **mechanism design**.

I've been on a research internship at University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Simon Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/), where I worked on preference-based multi-agent RL.
I'm currently conducting research under the guidance of [Prof. Zhixuan Fang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/), and our research explores multi-LLM-annotators.

Please refer to my <a href="{{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}">CV</a> for more academic details about me.
