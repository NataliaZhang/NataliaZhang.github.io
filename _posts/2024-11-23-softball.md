## Softball and Me
Softball is a fantastic sport!
I started playing softball when I entered Tsinghua University in 2021, and it has been my favorite sport ever since.

Visit my WeChat post [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fWlLqW4PSBXamksC2DPTAg) to learn about my story with softball in Tsinghua!

As an outfielder, I love to chase down fly balls. When I'm on the field, my teammates trust me to make the catch, and I try my best to fulfill their trust. It's the combination of teamwork and individual effort that makes softball so special.

Batting is my favorite part. The moment I step into the batter's box, I get the control of the game.

This season has been a testament to the hard work, teamwork, and passion that defines our softball team. We are ready for the challenges of next season, and we know we will be even stronger.

Our coach quoted the following lines to inspire us to embody the spirit of teamwork. These are from *Teammate: My Journey in Baseball and a World Series for the Ages* by David Ross, former Chicago Cubs catcher. 

- to be honest with everyone around you,  
- to be humble no matter how good things get,  
- to be reliable and consistent so that everyone knows what to expect,  
- to willingly share your experiences with others,  
- to manage change with a smile and stay engaged with everyone so that you can know how best to inspire them.

These exactly define our team. We are teammates, and we are family. We are Tsinghua softball team, and we are champions.
