## Softball and Me
Softball is a fantastic sport!
I started playing softball when I entered Tsinghua University in 2021, and it has been my favorite sport ever since.

    Batting is my favorite part. The moment stepping into the batter's box, I get the control of the game.

This season has been a testament to the hard work, teamwork, and passion that defines our softball team. We are ready for the challenges of next season, and we know we will be even stronger.

Our coach quoted the following lines to inspire us to embody the spirit of teamwork. These are from *Teammate: My Journey in Baseball and a World Series for the Ages* by David Ross, former Chicago Cubs catcher. 

- to be honest with everyone around you,  
- to be humble no matter how good things get,  
- to be reliable and consistent so that everyone knows what to expect,  
- to willingly share your experiences with others,  
- to manage change with a smile and stay engaged with everyone so that you can know how best to inspire them.
