## Softball and Me
Softball is a fantastic sport!
I started playing softball when I entered Tsinghua University in 2021, and it has been my favorite sport ever since.

Our coach quoted the following lines to inspire us to embody the spirit of teamwork. These are from *Teammate: My Journey in Baseball and a World Series for the Ages* by David Ross, former Chicago Cubs catcher. 

- to be honest with everyone around you,  
- to be humble no matter how good things get,  
- to be reliable and consistent so that everyone knows what to expect,  
- to willingly share your experiences with others,  
- to manage change with a smile and stay engaged with everyone so that you can know how best to inspire them.
